# Sample Custom Hook Plugin

## What is it?

The Sample Custom Hook Plugin serves as a demonstration of how developers can create their own custom hooks. This plugin includes a button that displays the label "See preview of next slide". When you click on the button, a modal will open with a preview of the next slide.

Another feature of this plugin is the alert popup that appears with the count of the users with the same name as the current user (self user).

## Running the Plugin from Source

1. Start the development server:

```bash
cd $HOME/src/bigbluebutton-html-plugin-sdk/samples/sample-custom-subscription-plugin
npm install
npm start
```

2. Add reference to it on BigBlueButton's `settings.yml`:

```yaml
  plugins:
    - name: SampleCustomSubscriptionPlugin
      url: http://127.0.0.1:4701/static/SampleCustomSubscriptionPlugin.js
```

## Building the Plugin

To build the plugin for production use, follow these steps:

```bash
cd $HOME/src/bigbluebutton-html-plugin-sdk/samples/sample-custom-subscription-plugin
npm install
npm run build-bundle
```

The above command will generate the `dist` folder, containing the bundled JavaScript file named `SampleCustomSubscriptionPlugin.js`. This file can be hosted on any HTTPS server.

To use the plugin with BigBlueButton, add the plugin's URL to `settings.yml` as shown below:

```yaml
public:
  app:
    ... // All app configurations
  plugins:
    - name: sampleCustomSubscriptionPlugin
      url: <<PLUGIN_URL>>
  ... // All other configurations
```

Alternatively, you can host the bundled file on the BigBlueButton server by copying `dist/SampleCustomSubscriptionPlugin.js` to the folder `/var/www/bigbluebutton-default/assets/plugins`. In this case, the `<<PLUGIN_URL>>` will be `https://<your-host>/plugins/SampleCustomSubscriptionPlugin.js`.
